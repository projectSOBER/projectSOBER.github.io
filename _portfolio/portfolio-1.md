As part of the development of **Project S.O.B.E.R.**, a stratospheric balloon experiment to evaluate Resident Space Objects (RSOs), this document provides an analysis of the payloadâ€™s weight breakdown and mounting design. The report addresses feedback from the proposal phase, offering insights into the mission's technical design choices and alignment with past successful projects.

### Weight Breakdown

The payload weight estimation combines known components and projections based on similar missions, such as **RSONAR** and **IRISC**. For S.O.B.E.R., the total estimated mass, including a safety factor, is approximately **~8kg**, ensuring compliance with the **BEXUS** payload limit of 100 kg.

Key components include:  
- **RADIA M100 infrared camera**: 820 g  
- **UI-3370CP-M-GL camera**: 52 g  
- Generic payload parts, fasteners, and aluminum frames: ~5,000 g  

### Payload Mounting Design

To optimize the **field of view (FOV)** for observing RSOs, the payload sensors are mounted at a 45-degree angle. The mounting design incorporates learnings from missions like RSONAR and IRISC, ensuring unobstructed data collection and minimizing atmospheric distortion. The payload includes both a **monochrome camera** and a **thermal imaging camera**, each equipped with carefully chosen lenses to meet mission objectives.

The proposed mounting configuration has been diagrammed for clarity and precision, supporting the mission's scientific goals.
