## Overview

The **Space Object Brightness Evaluation and Reference (S.O.B.E.R.)** project is a stratospheric balloon mission designed to measure the brightness and thermal emissions of Resident Space Objects (RSOs). The mission aims to evaluate the impact of these objects on dark skies, aligning with the European Space Agency's (ESA) debris mitigation policies to promote space sustainability. By utilising high-altitude conditions to minimise atmospheric distortion, the S.O.B.E.R. project seeks to improve the quality and accuracy of space debris observations.

## Mission Objectives

### Primary Objectives:
- **Measure RSO Brightness**: Capture photometric data of space debris and satellites to quantify their impact on dark skies.
- **Space Situational Awareness (SSA)**: Provide observational data to enhance SSA cataloguing and contribute to ESA’s space sustainability framework.

### Secondary Objectives:
- **Multi-Spectral Data**: Use visible and infrared (IR) sensors to characterise materials and thermal emissions of RSOs.
- **Comparison with Ground Observations**: Validate balloon data against ground-based observations to assess atmospheric effects.

## Background

The S.O.B.E.R. project team was formed during the ESA Academy Space Debris Training Course held in 2024 in Belgium. The initiative focuses on supporting ESA's objectives to protect "dark skies" by analysing light pollution caused by RSOs. This mission is part of ESA’s broader effort to reduce artificial light pollution, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the orbital environment.

Our international collaboration includes academic and industry experts from Canada and Europe, with Telops contributing infrared sensors and engineering support. By gathering high-quality, high-altitude data, we aim to support ESA's goals for sustainable space operations and enhance our understanding of space debris behaviour.
