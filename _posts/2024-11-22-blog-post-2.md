We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that **Project S.O.B.E.R. (Space Object Brightness Evaluation and Reference)** has been shortlisted for the **ESA REXUS/BEXUS program (Cycle 16)!**  

Over the last two months, our core team of five expanded to a group of 15 students from diverse academic backgrounds across the globe. Together, we‚Äôve developed an innovative mission addressing the challenges of space debris while aligning with **ESA‚Äôs Zero Debris policy.**  

### Mission Objectives  
üî≠ **RSO Surveillance at High Altitudes**  
Measuring the brightness and thermal emissions of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) at 27 km and comparing the data with ground-based observations.  

üõ†Ô∏è **Technology Testing**  
Demonstrating and validating state-of-the-art sensors in collaboration with our industry partners.  

### Key Milestones  
- **Sept. 30th:** Collaboration initiated during ESA Space Debris Training.  
- **Oct. 14th:** Initial project proposal submitted.  
- **Nov. 10th:** Final proposal submitted.  
- **Nov. 22nd:** Preparation for the Selection Workshop completed.  

Our team will present our mission idea next week at **ESA/ESTEC** during the REXUS/BEXUS Selection Workshop. We‚Äôre excited to showcase our project‚Äôs potential to a panel of industry experts.  

### Meet the Team  
**Core Members:** Joshua Amar, Alice-Elena Bucur, Saranga Kaveen Malawanna, Andrei Gherasim, Joost Hubbard, Barnab√°s Jenofi, Melina K√ºbler, Miron Ionu»õ-Robert, Joaquin Philco, Karanpreet R., Marta Scherillo, Lovejivan Sidhu, Gurpreet Singh, Saranya Sivaneshon, Vithurshan Suthakar.  

**Supervising Professors and Mentors:**  
- Dr. **Vitali Braun** (ESA / IMS Space Consultancy GmbH)  
- Professor **Jean-Pierre Hickey** (University of Waterloo)  
- Professor **Regina Lee** (York University)  
- Professor **Franz Newland** (University of Ottawa)  
- Professor **Steven Young** (University of Waterloo)  

### Industry Partnerships  
We‚Äôre proud to collaborate with **Telops, ABB,** and our new partner, **Romanian InSpace Engineering (RISE).** These partnerships enhance our technical capabilities and strengthen our commitment to promoting sustainable space operations.  

Our mission also has broader visibility as we‚Äôve submitted an abstract for the **ESA Space Debris Conference (2025)**, showcasing the innovative aspects of our project and its alignment with global space sustainability goals.  

Thank you to everyone supporting us on this journey‚Äîwe look forward to sharing more updates soon!
